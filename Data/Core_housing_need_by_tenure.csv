Footnotes:
1,"Core housing need refers to whether a private household's housing falls below at least one of the indicator thresholds for housing adequacy, affordability or suitability, and would have to spend 30% or more of its total before-tax income to pay the median rent of alternative local housing that is acceptable (attains all three housing indicator thresholds). Housing indicator thresholds are defined as follows. Adequate housing is reported by their residents as not requiring any major repairs. Affordable housing has shelter costs equal to less than 30% of total before-tax household income. Suitable housing has enough bedrooms for the size and composition of resident households according to the National Occupancy Standard (NOS), conceived by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and provincial and territorial representatives. Only private, non-farm, non-reserve and owner- or renter-households with incomes greater than zero and shelter-cost-to-income ratios less than 100% are assessed for core housing need. Non-family households with at least one maintainer aged 15 to 29 attending school are considered not to be in core housing need regardless of their housing circumstances. Attending school is considered a transitional phase, and low incomes earned by student households are viewed as being a temporary condition."
2,"Estimates appearing in this table were subjected to rounding."
3,"All geographic regions are based on the 2021 Census boundaries."
4,""Tenure" refers to whether the household owns or rents their private dwelling."
5,"Households are classified as first-time homebuyers if households own their current dwelling and: either the reference person indicated on the survey that they moved within the last five years (and previously rented or lived rent-free), or the reference person or their spouse (at the time of their home purchase) made use of first-time homebuyer tax incentives in the four calendar years preceding the reference year based on linked administrative data. To be eligible for tax incentives for first-time homebuyers, the homebuyer must not have lived in another home they or their current spouse or common-law partner owned during the preceding four years and must intend to occupy their new home within one year of purchasing it."
6,""Social and affordable housing" refers to "non-market rental housing" (that is, where housing allocation and rent-setting mechanisms are not entirely dictated by supply and demand)."
